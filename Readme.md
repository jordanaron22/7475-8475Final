# 7475-8475Final
Final Project for Pubh7475/8475


# 4-21

Added day and season vardiable from DATE. New variables named DAY and SEASON. 

Discretized the four distances to transit. New variable has _Disc at the end (i.e. Orig_Rail_Meter to Orig_Rail_Meter_Disc)

3 Tree methods (full, pruned, and random forest). Did test/train for full and prune

# 4-22

Cleaned up decision trees. Got rid of rf since no interpretability. Two different levels of pruning. Better visualization of trees
